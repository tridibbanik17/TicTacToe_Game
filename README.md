# TicTacToe_Game
_TicTacToeGame provides a basic board with 3 by 3 grid size to play the game in three different modes: Human vs Human, Human vs Computer and Computer vs Computer._

_TicTacToeGameExtended provides a board between 3 by 3 and 20 by 20 grid size. The user can choose the desired board size and win condition. For example, choosing a 5*5 board will display a 5 by 5 grid size board and choosing 3 as the win condition means whoever player gets three of their markers placed together in a straight line wins._

_There are two types of computer players: a regular computer that generates random moves and a smart computer that generates strategic moves with the purpose of blocking the opponent and winning the game._
